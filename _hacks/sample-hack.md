## Problem

When working with Ethereum smart contracts, you might encounter situations where you need to decode complex ABI data structures. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with nested arrays or dynamic types.

## Solution

Here's a simple solution using ethers.js to decode complex ABI data:

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers');

async function decodeComplexABI(encodedData, abi) {
    const iface = new ethers.utils.Interface(abi);
    const decoded = iface.parseTransaction({ data: encodedData });
    return decoded.args;
}
```

## Explanation

The solution uses ethers.js's Interface class to parse the encoded data according to the provided ABI. This approach handles all types of ABI encoding, including:

- Dynamic arrays
- Nested structures
- Fixed-size arrays
- Complex types

## Usage Example

```javascript
const abi = [
    "function transfer(address[] recipients, uint256[] amounts)"
];

const encodedData = "0x..."; // Your encoded data here

const decoded = await decodeComplexABI(encodedData, abi);
console.log(decoded);
```

## Additional Tips

1. Always validate input data before decoding
2. Handle potential errors gracefully
3. Consider gas costs when working with complex data structures
